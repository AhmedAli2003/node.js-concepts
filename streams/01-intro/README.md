# Node.js Performance Benchmark: Asynchronous vs Synchronous File Write

This folder contains a benchmark comparing the performance of asynchronous and synchronous file write operations in Node.js. The goal is to understand why the synchronous version outperforms the asynchronous version in this specific context.

## Performance Analysis

The significant performance difference observed between the asynchronous and synchronous versions is due to the following reasons:

### Event Loop Overhead

- **Asynchronous Version**: Each `await` statement in the loop introduces a point at which the event loop can be yielded back to handle other tasks. This context switching between the event loop and your code adds significant overhead, especially when dealing with a large number of I/O operations.
- **Synchronous Version**: The synchronous `fs.writeSync` method blocks the event loop until the write operation is complete. This blocking operation avoids the overhead associated with context switching in the event loop, leading to much faster execution in a tight loop.

### I/O Operations

- **Asynchronous Version**: Even though asynchronous operations are non-blocking and can potentially improve performance by allowing other operations to run concurrently, the overhead of handling many small asynchronous operations can outweigh their benefits. Each `await` involves a promise being created and resolved, which adds computational overhead.
- **Synchronous Version**: Synchronous I/O operations directly write to the file without creating and resolving promises for each write. This results in a more straightforward and faster execution path.

### Batch Processing

- In the synchronous version, each `fs.writeSync` call directly writes to the file descriptor, while in the asynchronous version, `await fileHandler.write` is creating many separate asynchronous write operations that have to be managed and queued by the event loop.

### Summary

- **Asynchronous Version** involves the event loop and promise resolution, which adds overhead.
- **Synchronous Version** directly performs I/O operations without context switching, leading to better performance in this specific case.

While asynchronous operations are generally preferred in Node.js to prevent blocking the event loop, in this scenario where a large number of write operations are performed in a tight loop, the synchronous version outperforms due to lower overhead. However, this synchronous approach should be used with caution in real-world applications to avoid blocking the event loop and degrading performance for other operations.
