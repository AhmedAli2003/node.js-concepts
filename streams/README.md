# Node.js Streams Course

In this course, you will learn about the different types of streams available in Node.js and how to use and implement them effectively. Here is an overview of the topics covered:

## Course Outline

### 1. Using Writable Streams

Learn how to use writable streams to efficiently write data to a destination, such as a file or network socket. Understand the internal buffer mechanism and how to handle backpressure.

### 2. Implementing Writable Streams

Implement your own writable stream by extending the `Writable` class. Learn how to manage the internal buffer and handle the `write` and `final` methods.

### 3. Using Readable Streams

Understand how to use readable streams to read data from a source, such as a file or network socket. Learn about the internal buffer and how to handle data events.

### 4. Implementing Readable Streams

Create your own readable stream by extending the `Readable` class. Implement methods to push data into the internal buffer and control the flow of data.

### 5. Implementing Duplex Streams

Learn how to implement duplex streams, which are both readable and writable. Extend the `Duplex` class and handle both input and output operations within a single stream.

### 6. Using Duplex Streams

Understand how to use duplex streams for operations that require both reading and writing data, such as network communication or file transformation.

### 7. Implementing Transform Streams

Implement transform streams by extending the `Transform` class. Learn how to modify or transform the data as it passes through the stream.

### 8. Using Transform Streams

Discover how to use transform streams to process and manipulate data in real-time. Implement common use cases such as data compression, encryption, and format conversion.

## Conclusion

By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of how to use and implement various types of streams in Node.js, enabling you to handle large amounts of data efficiently and effectively in your applications.
